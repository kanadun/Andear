        <div class="answer1">
            <p>A deer (pl.: deer) or true deer is a hoofed ruminant ungulate of the family Cervidae. It is divided into
                subfamilies Cervinae (which includes, among others, muntjac, elk (wapiti), red deer, and fallow deer)
                and Capreolinae (which includes, among others reindeer (caribou), white-tailed deer, roe deer, and
                moose). Male deer of almost all species (except the water deer), as well as female reindeer, grow and
                shed new antlers each year. These antlers are bony extensions of the skull and are often used for combat
                between males.</p><br>
            <p>The musk deer (Moschidae) of Asia and chevrotains (Tragulidae) of tropical African and Asian forests are
                separate families that are also in the ruminant clade Ruminantia; they are not especially closely
                related to Cervidae.</p><br>
            <p>Deer appear in art from Paleolithic cave paintings onwards, and they have played a role in mythology,
                religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in heraldry, such as red deer that appear in the
                coat of arms of Åland. Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison, their
                skins as soft, strong buckskin, and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer hunting has been a popular
                activity since the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.</p><br>

            <h1>Etymology and terminology:-</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="answer2">
            <p>The word deer was originally broad in meaning, becoming more specific with time. Old English dēor and
                Middle English der meant a wild animal of any kind. Cognates of Old English dēor in other dead Germanic
                languages have the general sense of animal, such as Old High German tior, Old Norse djur or dȳr, Gothic
                dius, Old Saxon dier, and Old Frisian diar. This general sense gave way to the modern English sense
                by the end of the Middle English period, around 1500. All modern Germanic languages save English and
                Scots retain the more general sense: for example, Dutch/Frisian dier, German Tier, and Norwegian dyr
                mean animal.</p><br>
            <p>For many types of deer in modern English usage, the male is a buck and the female a doe, but the terms
                vary with dialect, and according to the size of the species. The male red deer is a stag, while for
                other large species the male is a bull, the female a cow, as in cattle. In older usage, the male of any
                species is a hart, especially if over five years old, and the female is a hind, especially if three or
                more years old. The young of small species is a fawn and of large species a calf; a very small young
                may be a kid. A castrated male is a havier.[6] A group of any species is a herd. The adjective of
                relation is cervine; like the family name Cervidae, this is from Latin: cervus, meaning stag or deer.
