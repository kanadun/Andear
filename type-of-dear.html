            <p>The chital or cheetal (Axis axis; /tʃiːtəl/), also known as the spotted deer, chital deer and axis deer,
                is a deer species native to the Indian subcontinent. It was first described and given a binomial name by
                German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. A moderate-sized deer, male chital reach
                90 cm (35 in) and females 70 cm (28 in) at the shoulder. While males weigh 70–90 kg (150–200 lb),
                females weigh around 40–60 kg (88–132 lb). It is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and
                antlers are present only on males. The upper parts are golden to rufous, completely covered in white
                spots. The abdomen, rump, throat, insides of legs, ears, and tail are all white. The antlers,
                three-pronged, are nearly 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long.</p><br>

            <h1>Etymology:-</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="answer2">
            <p>The vernacular name "chital" (pronounced /tʃiːtəl/) comes from cītal (Hindi: चीतल), derived from the
                Sanskrit word citrala (चित्रल), meaning "variegated" or "spotted". The name of the cheetah has a
                similar origin. Variations of "chital" include "cheetal" and "cheetul". Other common names for the
                chital are Indian spotted deer (or simply the spotted deer) and axis deer.</p><br>

        <div class="answer3">
            <p>The reindeer or caribou (Rangifer tarandus) is a species of deer with circumpolar distribution,
                native to Arctic, subarctic, tundra, boreal, and mountainous regions of Northern Europe, Siberia, and
                North America. It is the only representative of the genus Rangifer. More recent studies suggest the
                splitting of reindeer and caribou into six distinct species over their range.</p><br>
            <p>Reindeer occur in both migratory and sedentary populations, and their herd sizes vary greatly in
                different regions. The tundra subspecies are adapted for extreme cold, and some are adapted for
                long-distance migration.</p><br>
            <p>Reindeer vary greatly in size and color from the smallest, the Svalbard reindeer (R. (t.) platyrhynchus),
                to the largest, Osborn's caribou (R. t. osborni). Although reindeer are quite numerous, some species and
                subspecies are in decline and considered vulnerable. They are unique among deer (Cervidae) in that
                females may have antlers, although the prevalence of antlered females varies by subspecies.</p><br>
            <p>Reindeer are the only successfully semi-domesticated deer on a large scale in the world. Both wild and
                domestic reindeer have been an important source of food, clothing, and shelter for Arctic people from
                prehistorical times. They are still herded and hunted today. In some traditional Christmas legends,
                Santa Claus's reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help Santa Claus deliver gifts to good
                children on Christmas Eve.</p><br>

            <h1>Type No:3 is European fallow deer:-</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="answer4">
            <p>The European fallow deer (Dama dama), also known as the common fallow deer or simply fallow deer, is a
                species of ruminant mammal belonging to the family Cervidae. It is historically native to Turkey and
                possibly the Italian Peninsula, Balkan Peninsula, and the island of Rhodes near Anatolia.
                Prehistorically
                native to and introduced into a larger portion of Europe, it has also been introduced to other regions
                in
                the world. It is one of two living species of fallow deer (Dama) alongside the Persian fallow deer (Dama
                mesapotamica).</p><br>

            <h1>Taxonomy</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="answer5">
            <p>Some taxonomists include the rarer Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (D. d. mesopotamica),[3] with both
                species being grouped together as the fallow deer, while others treat it as a different species (D.
                mesopotamica).[1] The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was once classified as Dama virginiana
                and the mule deer or black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) as Dama hemionus; they were given a
                separate genus in the 19th century.</p><br>
